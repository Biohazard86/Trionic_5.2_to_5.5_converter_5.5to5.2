# trionic_5.2to5.5_converter_5.5to5.2
Executable to convert binaries from Saab Trionic 5.2(128kb) to Trionic 5.5 (256kb) 
This executable doubles the binary to be able to occupy all the memory of Trionic 5.5 and to be able to use this ECU in a 5.2 engine.  
You can also convert your binary back to a 5.2 file to open it with T5Suite and tune it :)

EXECUTE IN LINUX:
---------------------
cd "path" 
./trionic_converter_biohazard_86
